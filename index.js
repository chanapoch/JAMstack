    <p>"My name is Rebecca. I am relatively brand-new to web coding but I like learning and want to improve my skills. This is why I am interested in joining freeCodeCamps upcoming hackathon, at least online... since I will not be able to get out to San Francisco any time soon. It would be my first hackathon ever!"</p>
