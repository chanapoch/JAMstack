    <h1>Hi everyone!</h1>
    <p>My name is Rebecca. I'm relatively new to web coding but I like learning and want to improve my skills. This is why I am interested in joining freeCodeCamp's upcoming hackathon, at least online... since I won't be able to get out to San Francisco any time soon. It would be my first hackathon ever!</p>
